        <p><strong>Question 1: </strong>What is git</p>
        <p><span style="color:red">Answer: </span>Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any
            set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively
            developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for
            distributed, non-linear workflows</p>
        <p><strong>Question 2: </strong>What is Github</p>
        <p><span style="color:red">Answer: </span>GitHub, Inc. is an AI-powered developer platform that allows
            developers to create, store, and manage their code. It uses Git software, providing the distributed version
            control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous
            integration, and wikis for every project.</p>
